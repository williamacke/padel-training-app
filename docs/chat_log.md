# Padel Training App Chat Log

I want to create an app that can be used by trainers an padel players. The goal is to have a good way for players to book lessons with the different trainers.

Trainers functionality:

- The trainers have a dashboard or page where they can modify their availability in a calendar view. Depending on the availability of the courts, slots will be created that players can select and book.
- Trainers also have an overview of the booked lessons with basic information, like timing, court, players information like their level ( For men it ranges from P100-P200-P300-P400-P500-P700-P1000; For Woman it ranges from P50-P100-P200-P300-P500-P700)
- Trainers will have to confirm the booked lesson by the players and go to the app to reserve the court.

Players functionality:

- They can have an overview of their booked lessons with general information, as when and which trainers on what court.
- They can book new lessons from the available trainers and the slots
- They can cancel lessons
- They have to select their level
- Of course they need to first register and will receive confirmation email when a trainer confirms the booked lesson.

Admin functionality:

- Admins can see all availability from all trainers
- User admin functionality
- Add specific blocks to overrule the availability of courts

The application will be mainly used on mobile phones but should also be nice on web. I will be coding in WSL and already created a folder padel-training-app.
I want to keep a track of the chat log so create a file where my prompt and your answers are saved. Also I want to have a development log where we can keep track of the steps and progress.

First thing is create a venv in this folder and activate it, then get to the different steps and the technology choices we need to make.

Now that we have basic authentication working, we can:
Add protected routes and user profile features:
Create a dashboard for logged-in users
Add profile management
Add authorization middleware to protect certain routes
Enhance the authentication system:
Add token refresh functionality
Add logout functionality
Add password reset capability
Add core padel training features:
Create training session scheduling
Add trainer-student matching
Add training history tracking
Which of these areas would you like to tackle first? I'd recommend starting with protected routes and a basic dashboard to ensure our authentication system is working properly.
Would you like to:
Create a protected dashboard component?
Add token-based route protection? 3. Add logout functionality?
Let me know which direction you'd prefer to go!
